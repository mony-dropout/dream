in my server, i have this folder /monyatwu ; and in sites enabled, this is my root. index is default.html
i wanna code the websites on my mac and then scp it onto the server there... 
there's going to be a folder webtest and another folder webfinal 
everytime, im going to scp -r webfinal/. mony@${IP}:/monyatwu; 
so basically at any point webfinal (on my mac) will be equal to monyatwu (on server) and this is the actual website being served
im going to write code in webtest and then cp it to webfinal (explaining reaoson soon)
but yeah in webtest im gonna use git etc normally no problem, but like whenver linking sites, like if i wanaa link http://monyatwu.com/blog/monymethod
i will instead write file:///Users/monyatwu/Documents/webtest/blog/monymethod 
the reason for thsi is, when you click on a html file on mac, it opens up that file in safari, so for rapid testing and seeing how my file looks, ill 
write all my code with file:/// thingy so that like i can click on it and check out how it looks etc. and then ill cp webtest to webfinal 
and then i'll do sed on webfinal like for f in webfinal : 
sed 's|file:///users/monyatwu/Documents/webtest|https://monyatwu.com|g' f.txt
and then i'll scp this onto /monyatwu and we're donezo :D
